# Energy-Analyzer-and-Mailer

This software takes energy consumption data of the user's showering behaviour as input and generates an Email for this user that visualizes the data. Thereby, the data is displayed in a way that the user is motivated to conserve energy.


## How does it work?

The input data is analyzed by means of statistical calculations. These results are used to generate an energy report about the users showering behaviour. In the report, psychological tricks are applied in order to achieve maximum conservation effects (e.g. theory of planned behaviour, peer group comparison, goal setting, gamification etc.).
After the report has been generated, users receive this report as an Email into their mailbox.


## Can I use this software?

The software is the outcome of a student project at the [Chair of Energy Efficient Systems, University of Bamberg](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/eesys/). During this project, we had access to consumption data, which is privacy
protected. Thus, the data is not publicly available and the software does not make sense to be executed without this related data. <br />
