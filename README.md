# Energy-Analyzer-and-Mailer
This software is a extension for the [Amphiro](https://www.amphiro.com/). It sends an Email report about the energy consumption during showers to each Amphiro user. Thereby, the data is displayed in a way that the user is motivated to conserve energy.


## How does it work?

The input data (= shower consumption data) is analyzed by means of statistical calculations. These results are used to generate an energy report about the users' showering behavior. In the report, psychological tricks are applied in order to achieve maximum conservation effects (e.g. theory of planned behavior, peer group comparison, goal setting, gamification etc.).
After the report has been generated, users receive this report as an Email into their mailbox. This is an example output of the software for a specific user:

## Can I use this software?

The software is the outcome of a student project at the [Chair of Energy Efficient Systems, University of Bamberg](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/eesys/). During this project, we had access to consumption data, which is privacy
protected. Thus, the data is not publicly available and the software does not make sense to be executed without this related data. <br />
