This tool takes energy consumption data as input and visualizes the data in a way that motivates the user to reduce his energy consumption.

The input data is analyzed by means of statistical calculations and displayed by applying psychological tricks in order to achieve maximum effects (e.g. theory of planned behaviour, peer group comparison, goal setting, gamification etc.).

This is the outcome of a project at the [Chair of Energy Efficient Systems, University of Bamberg](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/eesys/).

The Software cannot be executed without the data, which is privacy protected and not publicly available.
